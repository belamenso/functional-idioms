# Functional programming idioms

## TODO
* iterating with a helper function
* converting recursive algorithms to tail-recursive ones with an accumumulator
* when accumulator is not necessary
* relaying on recursion - easily expressing non-trivial computations
* pattern matching and simplifying problems
* generators
* continuations
* mutual recursion
* simulating laziness
